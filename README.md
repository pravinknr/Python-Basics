# Python Basics
 This Repository Contains Files that hold the Basics Codes of Python. I Have Used Spyder and Jupyter Notebooks IDE's available in Anaconda Navigator. Those who want to Learn Python From Scratch can go through these Codes.

***

### Download Anaconda Navigator

In order to perform These Codes, You need to *Download* and *Install* **Anaconda Navigator**.

#### Available For:
1. **Windows**
2. **MacOS**
3. **ubuntu**

*Download* and *Install* the **_Python 3.7_** Version.

[Click Here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to re-direct to the Download Page.

After the Installation, Open **Anaconda Navigator**. You will see Different Tools Offered by **Anaconda Navigator**. 

Click on the **_Launch_** Button Under **Spyder** or **Jupyter Notebook** to Use it. I would Recommend to use the **Jupyter Notebook** for Beginners as it's Easy and Simple to use.

If you Launch **Spyder**, You will be able to see the GUI similar to Rstudio(Those who are Familiar with rstudio.). The GUI is Divided into 3 Sections:

*1. The Left part Consists of the Editor.*

*2. The Right Part is Divided into Top and Bottom Section. The Top Section Consists of the Variable Explorer and File Explorer.*

*3. The Right Bottom Part Consists of the Ipython Console and History Log.*

The Extension for Saving Spyder file is **_".py"_**

If you Click on **_Launch_** **Jupyter Notebook**, a Web Browser will be Opened displaying the Localhost page with a port number. **Jupyter Notebooks** Runs on the Localhost Server. You can See all the Files that are Present in the Localhost server. On the Right side Top you will See a DropDown Button **_"New"_**, Click it and select **Python 3**. The Extension used to save Python Notebook is **_".ipynb"_**

Now the Python Notebook will Open and you can start your Coding part.
