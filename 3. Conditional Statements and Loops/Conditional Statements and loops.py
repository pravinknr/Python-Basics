#Conditional statements in Python
# 1. IF Condition (for 1 condition)
# 2. ELSE condtion (for 2 conditions)
# 3. IF ELIF ELSE condition (for more than 2 conditions)
#Loops #FOR Loops #WHILE Loops

#IF Condition

#Else Condition
    
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

#Nested IF Conditions
#Writing IF Condition inside an IF Condition

#FOR Loops
#FOR Loop executes the condition till the last element is reached
