#Operators

#To run a line, press fn(function)+F9

#Arithmetic Operators

a=10 #Assign value of a as 10 (Numeric/Integer)
b=20 #Assign value of b as 20 (Numeric/Integer)

a + b #Addition

a - b #Subtraction

b - a #Subtraction

a * b #Multiplication

a / b #Division

a // b #Remove the Decimal

a % b #Modulus (to get the remainder value)

a ** b #Exponential

#Comparison Operator - the output will be in a boolean datatype(TRUE,FALSE)


a = 20 #Assignment Operator

b = 30 #Assignment Operator

a == b #checks if a is equal to b 

a != b # checks if a is not equal to b - here ! stands for NOT

a <= b #checks if a is less than equal to b

a >= b #checks if a is greater than equal to b

a < b #checks if a is less than b

a > b #checks if a is gfeater than b

#Various Assignment operators

c = a + b #Assignment Operator

c += b # c = c + b

c -= a #c = c - a

c/= b #c = c / b

c *= a #c = c * a

c %= b #c = c % b

c **= b #c = c ** b

#Format

format(20,"b") #Converts 20 into Binary format
